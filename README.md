# Machine-Design
This project involves the design and kinematic analysis of a mechanical linkage system. The mechanism was modeled and simulated using Linkage (mechanism simulation software), and its motion characteristics were analyzed in MATLAB using position, velocity, and acceleration equations.

📐 Project Overview

A mechanical linkage mechanism (e.g., four-bar or slider-crank) was designed to achieve a specific motion output.

The mechanism was first implemented and animated using Linkage software to visualize the motion and determine link parameters.

Kinematic analysis (position, velocity, and acceleration) was performed using MATLAB to derive motion profiles over time.

🧮 Analysis Performed

Position Analysis: Equations were derived to describe the angular and linear positions of key links over time.

Velocity Analysis: First derivatives of the position equations were computed to determine angular and linear velocities.

Acceleration Analysis: Second derivatives provided insight into the dynamic behavior of the system under different inputs.

🛠️ Tools Used

Linkage – For mechanism modeling, motion simulation, and initial configuration testing.

MATLAB – For symbolic and numerical kinematic analysis, plotting of motion graphs, and verification of dynamic performance.

📊 Outputs

Time-based plots of:

Angular/linear position

Angular/linear velocity

Angular/linear acceleration

Graphs used to evaluate smoothness and efficiency of the mechanism's motion.

📌 Applications

This project demonstrates core mechanical design and kinematic analysis principles. It is suitable for academic coursework, mechanical system prototyping, or early-stage development of motion-based machinery such as linkages, cams, or robotics.
